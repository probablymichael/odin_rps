# Rock Paper Scissors (The Odin Project)

> This is a new repo because I *broke* the previous one by making a directory and something like that, I really dont know. Well that explains the lack of commits. The previous repo had more than 30 commits.

:computer: This project is part of the JavaScript Basics, which is in the Foundations.

:thinking: In this project, we were asked to, *firstly*, create a work rock-paper scissors game in the console, using prompt to get the player's choice and randomly selecting the computer's choice.

:writing_hand: The skills needed for this project were the basics. Variables, functions, if statements, loops (in the console version) and a lot of other stuff needed.

Although, to create the UI, you have to know how to "manipulate" the **DOM**, which happened to be the previous lessons. Y'know:
- Event Listeners
- textContent
- querySelector, etc

# Icon Credits

:100: You might have noticed that in the reset button, theres a cross icon, basically decoration.
Well, that icon was taken from <a href='feathericons.com'> **Feather Icons**</a>.

All icons used in [the project](#rock-paper-scissors-the-odin-project), *which happens to be only one*, are in /icons/ directory.
